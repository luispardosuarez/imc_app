# Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator

## Overview

This BMI Calculator is a simple Java application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). It's a straightforward program developed as part of the introductory exercises for the Full Stack Bootcamp at FactorÃ­a F5. The application takes user input for weight and height, calculates the BMI, and provides a result based on predefined BMI ranges.

## Technology Used

The BMI Calculator is built using:

- **Java:** The programming language used for the application logic.
- **Maven:** Dependency management and build automation tool.

## Installation

To run the BMI Calculator on your local machine, make sure you have Java and Maven installed. If you're using Visual Studio Code, Java might be installed using the Visual Studio Code Java Extension Pack. Additionally, Maven can be installed separately or as part of your Java development environment.

Here's a brief guide for Visual Studio Code:

1. **Install Java Extension Pack:**
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Go to Extensions (you can use `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
   - Search for "Extension Pack for Java" and install it.

2. **Install Maven:**
   - Maven is often included in Java Development Kits (JDK). Ensure you have a JDK installed.
   - If not, you can install Maven separately by following the instructions on the [official Apache Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

## Usage

1. Clone or download the BMI Calculator repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
